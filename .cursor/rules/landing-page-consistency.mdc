# Landing Page Consistency Rule

This rule ensures that changes made to one landing page are considered for application to other landing pages to maintain consistency across the site.

## When This Rule Applies

This rule applies when making changes to:
- Landing page components in [src/app/(landing-pages)](mdc:src/app/(landing-pages))
- Village data files in [src/data/villages](mdc:src/data/villages)
- Template components in [src/components/templates](mdc:src/components/templates)
- Any shared components or utilities that affect landing page functionality

## Current Landing Pages

The project currently has the following landing pages:
- **Collier Park**: [src/app/(landing-pages)/collier-park/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(landing-pages)/collier-park/page.tsx)
- **Moline Village**: [src/app/(landing-pages)/moline-village/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(landing-pages)/moline-village/page.tsx)

## Required Workflow

When making changes to any landing page or related components, you MUST:

1. **Complete the requested change** on the target landing page
2. **Identify the scope** of the change (component, styling, functionality, data, etc.)
3. **Ask the user** if the same change should be applied to the other landing page(s)
4. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding with additional changes
5. **Apply changes consistently** if approved by the user

## Example Prompt

After completing a change, use this format:

```
## Change Complete

I've successfully [brief description of change] for [landing page name].

### Change Details:
- [Specific details of what was modified]
- [Files that were changed]

### Consistency Check:
Should this same change be applied to [other landing page name] to maintain consistency across the site?

[Brief explanation of why this change might be beneficial for consistency]
```

## Types of Changes That Should Be Considered

- **UI/UX improvements**: Layout changes, styling updates, component enhancements
- **Functionality additions**: New features, interactive elements, form improvements
- **Content updates**: Text changes, image updates, contact information
- **Performance optimizations**: Code improvements, loading enhancements
- **Accessibility improvements**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **SEO enhancements**: Meta tags, structured data, page titles

## Exceptions

This rule does NOT apply to:
- Changes that are specific to a particular village's unique characteristics
- Content that is inherently different between villages (location-specific information, unique amenities)
- Experimental or temporary changes marked as such
- Bug fixes that are specific to one landing page's implementation

## Enforcement

This rule has `alwaysApply: true` and must be followed for ALL changes to landing page components, regardless of the specific request or context. The goal is to maintain a consistent user experience across all Amana Living village landing pages.
